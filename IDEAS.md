# Ideas


 - **Create a Mood**: Examples for possible moods: (adventurous, calm, festive, evil, creepy, ...)
 - **Mood Song Playlists**: For each mood, pick songs that will be played in that mood. Maybe use [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-track)
 - **Add Map Resources**: Add campaign material and especially maps to the database, and assign moods to each map.
 - **Specify Grid**: Specify grid dimensions for each map so that it matches the image. Also specify physical screen size to always have matching zoom levels for each map. Also show helper indicators on the side (Feet, Meters, Fields)
 - **Fights**: Start a new fight on a map (automatically save information about the fight in the database).
 - **Turn Order**: For each fight, save the initiative of each player and display the turn order on the screen. Also display status effects like stunned, concentrated etc.
 - **Custom Timer**: Start a custom timer that is displayed on the screen (optional timer label)
